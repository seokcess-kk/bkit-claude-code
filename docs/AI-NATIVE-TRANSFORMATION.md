## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 What is Bkit?

```
Claude Code + PDCA Methodology + 9-Stage Pipeline + Zero Script QA
= AI-Native Development Framework
```

### 1.2 Key Adoption Benefits

| Metric | As-Is | To-Be | Improvement |
|--------|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Team Size** | 10 people | 4 people | 60% reduction |
| **Development Speed** | Baseline | 3x faster | 67% time savings |
| **Design-Implementation Alignment** | 50-70% | 95% | 30%+ improvement |
| **Annual Cost** | $1.1M | $410K | 63% savings |

---

## 2. Development Process Comparison

### 2.1 As-Is vs To-Be

| Aspect | As-Is (Traditional) | To-Be (With Bkit) |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Methodology** | Waterfall or Agile (manual) | Automated PDCA cycle |
| **Documentation** | Code first, docs later (or skipped) | Design first → Code generation → Auto-sync |
| **Quality Verification** | Manual QA team testing | Zero Script QA (log-based auto-analysis) |
| **Knowledge Sharing** | In developers' heads / scattered docs | Single Source of Truth (CLAUDE.md) |
| **Onboarding** | 2-4 weeks (senior resource required) | Under 1 week (auto-referenced docs) |

### 2.2 Automated PDCA Cycle

```
Traditional Development Flow:
Requirements → [Manual] Design → [Manual] Coding → [Manual] Testing → [Manual] Documentation
                    ↓
          Communication overhead, omissions, inconsistencies at each stage

Bkit Development Flow:
Requirements → [Auto] Design Generation → [AI] Code Generation → [Auto] Verification → [Auto] Doc Sync
                    ↓
          Claude auto-applies PDCA at each stage, guaranteeing design-code alignment
```

## 3. Team Composition Comparison

### 3.1 Staffing Changes

| Role | As-Is (10-person baseline) | To-Be (Bkit) | Change |
|------|---------------------------|--------------|--------|
| **Project Manager** | 1 | 0.5 | PDCA auto-tracking |
| **Senior Developer** | 2 | 1 | AI guides architecture |
| **Junior Developer** | 4 | 2 | 3x productivity with AI |
| **QA Engineer** | 2 | 0.5 | Zero Script QA |
| **Technical Writer** | 1 | 0 | Auto-generated/synced docs |
| **Total** | **10** | **4** | **60% reduction** |

### 3.2 Role Transformation Details

```
Senior Developer:
  As-Is: Direct coding + Junior reviews + Architecture design
  To-Be: AI verification + Direction setting + Quality standards (AI-Native conductor)

Junior Developer:
  As-Is: Simple feature implementation, asks seniors questions
  To-Be: Can implement complex features through AI collaboration

QA Engineer:
  As-Is: Write and execute manual test scripts
  To-Be: Monitor logs, discover edge cases
```

## 4. Development Speed Comparison

### 4.1 Time Required by Feature Complexity

| Feature Size | As-Is | To-Be (Bkit) | Improvement |
|--------------|-------|--------------|-------------|
| Simple CRUD | 2-3 days | 2-4 hours | **80% faster** |
| Medium complexity | 1-2 weeks | 2-3 days | **70% faster** |
| Complex feature | 3-4 weeks | 1-2 weeks | **50% faster** |
| Full MVP | 3-6 months | 1-2 months | **60% faster** |

### 4.2 Speed Improvement Breakdown

```
1. Auto-generated boilerplate: -50% coding time
2. Design-code sync: -70% communication overhead
3. Zero Script QA: -80% QA time
4. Auto-documentation: -90% doc writing time
5. AI pair programming: -40% debugging time
```

---

## 5. Quality Comparison

### 5.1 Quality Metrics

| Quality Metric | As-Is | To-Be (Bkit) |
|----------------|-------|--------------|
| **Bug Discovery Timing** | Post-release | During development (log analysis) |
| **Design-Implementation Gap** | 30-50% | Under 5% (auto gap analysis) |
| **Code Consistency** | Varies by developer | Auto-applied conventions |
| **Security Vulnerabilities** | Found post-hoc | Pre-checked (Phase 7) |
| **Technical Debt** | Accumulates | Periodic analysis/resolution |

### 5.2 Zero Script QA Benefits

```
Traditional QA:
  Write test scripts (2 days) → Execute (1 day) → Find bugs → Fix → Retest
  ↓
  Test maintenance costs accumulate, edge cases missed

Zero Script QA:
  Build log infrastructure (one-time) → Manual UX testing → AI real-time analysis → Immediate issue detection
  ↓
  No test script maintenance, all API calls tracked
```

## 7. Risk Comparison

### 7.1 Risk Matrix

| Risk | As-Is | To-Be (Bkit) |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **Key Personnel Departure** | Critical (knowledge loss) | Low (documented knowledge) |
| **Project Delays** | Frequent | Predictable (PDCA tracking) |
| **Quality Issues** | Found post-release | Found/resolved during dev |
| **AI Dependency** | None | Requires management (verification skills) |

### 7.2 AI Dependency Risk Mitigation

```
Bkit's AI-Native 3 Core Competencies Training:
1. Verification Ability: Don't blindly trust AI output, verify
2. Direction Setting: Guide AI with clear requirements
3. Quality Standards: Communicate what good code looks like to AI

→ AI becomes "a partner that quickly builds the right thing"
   not "a tool that quickly builds the wrong thing"
```
